# Visualizing earnings college majors

In this project, I investigate data a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. 

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/analyzing_nyc_highschool_data/blob/main/AnalyzingNYCHighSchoolData.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and the .csv file. Make sure they are in the same folder.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot

## About the data sources

The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on [their Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

See the contents of the Notebook for more details about the data used.
